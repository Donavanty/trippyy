<strong>Motivation </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
When one travels for a vacation, the options available for planning his travels
are usually limited to the following: to either follow through with a planned
itinerary from a travel agency, or to research and plan an itinerary out from
scratch.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
In the process of planning for an itinerary, travellers are <strong>often met
with hassles</strong>. These include having to take into consideration the
following: travel costs (travel budget), modes of travel, the multiple locations
of their intended sites to visit and accommodation, and ensuring that their time
spent is maximised and not wasted on unnecessary activities such as
route-detours.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Therefore, we are inspired to <strong>build a user-friendly platform</strong>
where travellers can plan their trip with the activities they desire to do,
while <strong>skipping the hassles of dealing with the nitty-gritty
details</strong>, which would be<strong> dealt with by the algorithms in our
platform.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Aim </strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
We aim to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate algorithms that automatically suggest convenient and
well-thought-out itineraries which are practical in terms of geo-convenience,
time, and costs.
<li>Build programmes that seamlessly generate an itinerary based on minimal
input provided by the user.
<li>Incorporate an aesthetic and purposeful user interface for users to view
their itinerary, and conveniently make further adjustments/customisation of
their final itinerary if desired.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>User Stories</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Travellers who wish to <strong>build</strong> their itinerary with either
activities that are (i) <strong>keyed-in manually</strong>; or (ii)
<strong>auto-generated from our drop-down list/drop-pins on map</strong>, can
rely on our algorithm to optimise for an itinerary that presents a logical flow
of activities (e.g. low costs, minimal travelling distance…).
<li>Travellers who wish to <strong>share</strong> their itinerary with their
fellow travellers can do so using <em>trippyy</em>, where travellers can
collaborate and customise activities easily from the neat user interface.
<li>Travellers who wish to <strong>get a quick gauge of their trip
expenditure</strong> can do so from looking at the tabulation of costs in the
optimised itinerary generated, and further customise their trip to suit their
budget afterwards.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong>Competitor Analysis</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Currently, most major travel applications are focused on providing
accommodation or airline solutions for their users, and are not focused on
providing automated itineraries. There are however several trip-planning
applications which aim to automate and ease the process of trip-planning. Below
are some major players.
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>TripAdvisor</strong> - Whilst TripAdvisor is a great platform for
reading reviews, the trip-planning branch of the application only allows you to
add and keep track of locations in your trip. The planning of the trip with
regards to considering practical factors still has to be done manually.
<li><strong>Inspirock</strong> - Inspirock is a similar platform in which it
aims to fully automate trip-planning, and allow customization. Inspirock
provides users with a generic itinerary, and subsequently allows for changes.
However, this would lead to all users getting mostly generic itineraries, which
is in contrast with what we are setting out to do, where the user remains in
full control of what activities and attractions he/she wants to do/visit.
<li><strong>Funliday </strong>- Funliday allows you to key-in activities which
you want to do, and would automate to show you the travelling times needed to
move between locations. It then allows you to shift activity blocks around to
re-calculate travelling time. However, cost is not taken into consideration and
Funliday still requires a manual process where users would manually shift
activity blocks around in order to find the most time-efficient itinerary for
their trip.
<li><strong>TripIt - </strong>TripIt offers free conversion of documented
itineraries into an original app format that allows for live tracking,
customisation and updates for users during their trips, where travellers can
view a shared itinerary plan. However, every activity and its details needs to
be manually input by the user themselves (with no autocompletion) should they
not have an itinerary already done up. While this offers full customisation for
the users, it remains as basic as planning on any collaborative document.
<li><strong>Expedia </strong>- A majorly-established travel application.
Expedia,  however, does not provide automated trip-planning solutions, but
specific deals pertaining to hotel, flight, cruise and car rental bookings.
<li><strong>Manual planning </strong>- Given that average users who do not use
any trip-planning services would likely plan their trips using any
data-organisation platform such as Excel, they would do the following:
<li>Manually chart out the travelling time, ensuring that they visit attractions
that are close to each other on the same day such that no detours are made.
<li>Consider their budget, and calculate the total cost of their trip to ensure
that it is within budget.
<li>Check for travelling routes and their possible alternatives.
<li>Check for other miscellaneous factors, such as opening hours and weather
conditions for outdoor activities.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
In summary, the itinerary auto-curation scene remains rather untapped amidst
services whose nature are of manual itinerary planning (i.e. hotel bookings). We
aim to explore and develop itinerary auto-curation by piecing together the best
features currently implemented in the market. Not only do we believe that
improving upon these features would make <em>trippyy </em>stand out from its own
originality, we believe that these improvements are pivotal in defining how a
traveller’s experience should be.

<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Features</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
Under the scope of Orbital, a travel <strong>website interface </strong>hosting
the application for users to interact with would be developed, and we would
focus on planning itineraries for one city per trip only (i.e. Cross-city trips
are not supported). Refer to Diagram 1 for the illustrated user flow of
<em>trippyy</em>:
</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diagram 1. A simplified
illustration of the user flow of <em>trippyy</em>.</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
The flow will be subdivided into 3 phases:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Input Phase
<li>Shopping Phase
<li>Results Phase
</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Phase 1: Input
Phase:</span></strong>
</p>
<p>


<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pongzers/trippyy/blob/master/media/inputPhase.png" width="450" height="300">
</p>

<p align="center">
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diagram 2. A rough draft of
inputting location of travel, and number of days</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
Travellers start off by conveniently inputting the following into the platform:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Location of travel (refer to Diagram 2);
<li>Number of days of travel (refer to Diagram 2);
<li>Location of pre-arranged accommodation; (if available)
<p>
    The user is then offered two options:
</p>
<p>
    1. To select his/her activities for the itinerary of his/her trip
</p>
<p>
        2. To let the algorithm automatically select activities and generate
their itinerary subsequently.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diagram 3. Sample Aesthetic
Design (to be improved on)</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
This concludes the initial stage of inputs by the user, and the user can now
proceed to generate his/her optimised itinerary via Phase 2, the Shopping Phase.
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Phase 2: Shopping
Phase:</span></strong>
</p>

<p align="center">

<p align="center">
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diagram 4. A draft layout of
the Shopping Phase.</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
*This is a rough draft to showcase functionality, <strong>design would be
largely improved upon</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>**</strong>Aspect ratio of the above concept is not to scale
</p>
<p>
***A search option would be included as well, which is not reflected above.
</p>
<p>
Above illustrates the Shopping Phase page, which would be divided into 3
sections in vertical columns:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Details Column
<li>List Column
<li>Map Column
</li>
</ul>
<p>
(more of their functionalities explained later)
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">2 UI Modes for Shopping
Phase:</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
Upon inputting the required fields in the Input Phase, the user is then taken to
the Shopping Phase to selects his/her activities for their trip itinerary. This
will be done in 2 modes (see Diagram 5):
</p>
<p>
    Mode 1: List-centric Focus
</p>
<p>
    Mode 2: Geographic-centric Focus
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rationale for 2 Modes (a UI/UX
perspective):</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
The rationale for implementing 2 differing modes to select activities to
populate their itinerary would stem from the UI/UX benefits that each mode
offers over the other when choosing their activities.
</p>
<p>
A list-centric focus (Mode 1) would allow the user to see at a glance, the list
of activities at their respective locations available to them in a tiled-format
across the screen. Users would only have to <strong>focus their attention on the
nature of activities they wish to participate in </strong>via filters that
filter activities by categories<strong> and not on their locations </strong>(see
details)<strong>. </strong>This mode is catered for users who wish for their
itinerary to be <strong>filled with activities that best suit their
personality/interests/character. </strong>
</p>
<p>
A geographic-centric focus (Mode 2) on the other hand would<strong> place the
emphasis on the location of the activities</strong> that the user would like to
select for his/her itinerary. Users would be allowed to select their activities
from the map itself through drop-pins dotted across the map, and thus
<strong>see at a glance their destinations around the region </strong>they are
travelling to.<strong> </strong>This mode is catered for users who wish for
their itinerary to be <strong>filled with activities that are in close
proximity/would not require unfavourable travelling time over long
distances.</strong>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> A draft illustrating the
layout of the Columns of the Shopping Page of Model 1 (Right), and Model 2
(Left)</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Details of Mode 1 and Mode 2 of
Shopping Phase:</span></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>A list of popular activities/food locations would be recommended to the
user, organised in a tile-like layout that can be segregated by filters. These
will all be shown in the central column of the webpage (Refer to Diagram 6).
</li>
</ul>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diagram 6. A draft illustrating
a list of activities shown in a tile-like layout.</span></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>This would be done using data from Google Places API/Sygic Travel API, in
which filtered top-rated tourist activities and food locations would be
returned.
<p>
    For example:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Sight-seeing
<li>Singapore Zoo
<li>Art Science Museum
<li>…
<li>Shopping
<li>Bugis Street
<li>Marina Bay Sands
<li>...
<li>Food
<ol>
<li>Chomp Chomp Food Centre
<li>Whampoa Food Market
<li>...
<p>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The user would then select a list of items he/she would like to do in their
trip from the list, or have the option to add his/her own activities through a
search function.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mode 1:</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In Mode 1, the List Column will take up the equal real estate of the webpage
as the other columns would, at the centre. While the focus would be on the users
picking activities without needing to be concerned of their locations, a map
column still coexists on the right side of the webpage.
<li>The Map Column will be auto-populated with drop-pins of the activities’
locations as the user goes about selecting his/her activities from the list.
<li>The Details Column will also be auto-populated with data and necessary
details such as total expenses, total hours remaining to be filled with
activities selection, list of activities selected so far etc., as the user goes
about selecting his/her activities from the list.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Mode 2:</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>In Mode 2, the List Column will not exist, and the Map Column will instead
fill up the majority of the screen real estate of the webpage. In this mode,
users will select their activities from the drop-pins of recommended activities
on the map.
<li>The Details Column will likewise be auto-populated similarly to Mode 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Platform’s Itinerary
Output:</span></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The platform registers the aforementioned inputs, and returns an
auto-generated itinerary that is optimised based on the users' input.
<li>The auto-curation engine would first auto-curate according to the user’s
needs, followed by optimising the itinerary to be the most cost and
time-efficient by factoring several key factors such as geolocation, travel
costs from different travel options, etc. This results in an itinerary that is
both cost and time-efficient.
<li>A vertical layout of the itinerary is auto-generated and built live as the
user selects activities for his/her itinerary. This would be embedded in the
Details Column of the webpage (Refer to Diagram 7 for an example).
<li><em>Note that a horizontal layout of the itinerary will also be generated,
but this will only be shown in the Results Phase, where the screen real estate
is freed up from the disappearance of the Map Column since the user would not
need to select activities anymore. The horizontal layout of the itinerary is
shown in the Results Phase (Refer to Diagram 8 for an example).</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diagram 7. A rough draft of an

</p>
<p>
**This is only the summary portion of the output, a detailed day-to-day

</p>
<p>
*This is a rough draft to showcase functionality,<strong> design would be
largely improved upon.</strong>
</p>
<p>
**This is only the summary portion of the output, a detailed day-to-day
itinerary has not been reflected.
</p>
<p>
The Results Phase would consist of primarily of 2 main segments:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Details Column
<li>Horizontal Itinerary Layout
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Details Column would resemble the same Details sidebar as seen in the
Shopping Phase, displaying similar details.
</p>
<p>
The Horizontal Itinerary Layout will consist of blocks that would allow to be
sectioned according to the time span for each activity, across days of the week
that the user would be travelling on.
</p>
<p>
This is designed primarily for the following few reasons: a horizontal layout
spanning across days puts emphasis on the timespan of each activity, which will
allow for users to appreciate/get a sense for the level of activity to be done
on each day, and across the timespan of their trip. Moreover, users can easily
customise their itinerary by shifting block of activities around according to
their preference, one of which includes the addition of premeditated activities
into their itinerary (<em>see section on Further Info below</em>).
</p>

<p>
In addition, options for sharing the itinerary will be made available in the
section below of the Horizontal Itinerary Layout. This would allow users to
share their itinerary via hyperlinks which the public can access to to view the
itinerary. Alternatively, the user can export/download the horizontal itinerary
as a PDF/PNG file in which they can share by their own means afterwards.
</p>



<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Summary of the 3 Phases:</span></strong>
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/pongzers/trippyy/blob/master/media/flowchart.png" width="800" height="600">
</p>

<p align="center">
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Diagram 10. <em>trippyy</em>’s Web Architecture</span></strong>
</p>


<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Additional User
Input:</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
After the auto-generation of the itinerary, travellers can optionally do the
following:
</p>
<p>
(With each change, the itinerary may tweak and return a new itinerary to
re-optimise cost and time)
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rearrange and Customise</strong>
<ul>
<li>Suggested Activities; and
<li>Suggested Modes of Transportation.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Users would be able to easily click and drag any selected activity into a
different time slot, in which the algorithm would then re-optimise the itinerary
(in the event that users want to visit an attraction at a specific date and
time).
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Add premeditated custom activities into the itinerary:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Add the location and time of the pre-planned activity. This gives users the
option to allow the algorithm to reorganise the itinerary in a way that brings
the most geo-convenience to the user; and
<li>Add the cost of the activity, which factors in total cost.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Further information on the
intended functionality of the algorithm and platform:</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. Number of Days criteria:</strong> For both Option 1 and 2,<strong>
</strong>based on the number of days input by the user, a certain number of
activities would be suggested to him/her. This will be calculated by factoring
in average durations for these activities onto the total duration of the trip
(which will be provided by Google Places API).
</p>
<p>
For example:
</p>
<p>
    Number of days: 3 days 2 nights
</p>
<p>
    => Number of activities suggested: 2 sightseeing activities, 8 food places,
and 4 shopping places.
</p>
<p>
<strong>2. Fixed Activities criteria: </strong>Users can also
construct/customise their itinerary that takes into consideration several fixed
location and timings for certain events they have in mind (the algorithm builds
around these criteria). This is done after the itinerary is generated in the
Results Phase.
</p>
<p>
<strong>3. Customisation of Modes of Transport (‘Upgrade’ option): </strong>The
default itinerary returned would use the cheapest transport option in its
cost-tabulation. However, for longer trips, an alternative ‘upgrade’ option
would be made available to the user. (This is done with the help of Google
Places API.) This option would be higher in transport costs, but would save a
significant amount of time (e.g. travelling via a Taxi, Bullet Train in Japan
instead), and an optimised itinerary would be built around the ‘upgraded’ option
as well.
</p>
<p>
The ‘upgrade’ option would also show how much the increase in cost would be and
how much time they would be able to save, in comparison to the original mode of
transport that minimises travel costs with longer transport time. This would
enable the user to visually & more easily decide on which option he/she would
want to use for their trip. Users can switch to either option at any time, and
the itinerary would be adjusted accordingly.
</p>
<p>
<strong>4. Enhanced User Interaction:</strong> Once the itinerary is
auto-generated, the user can view the itinerary at a glance across a
user-friendly horizontal/vertical timetable, where blocks of activities can be
rearranged according to their preference.
</p>
<p>
<strong>5. Collaboration: </strong>Users can download a picture of their
itinerary, and obtain a unique sharing link that can be shared with others for
others to view the itinerary online,
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Future
enhancements:</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
This section discusses future plans and developments for <em>trippyy</em>. There
are functionalities that could be added in order to enhance the user’s
experience when using <em>trippyy,</em> effectively allowing the user to put in
less effort in planning for their trip. These are illustrated in the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li><em>trippyy</em>, which is a travel web application, should ideally be
implemented as an application for iOS and Android too.
<ol>
<li>Add the extension of importing/exporting itineraries into common formats
such as Excel, or PDF.
<ol>
<li>Add features that respond to real-time data such as user’s location and
weather. These could include recommendations of other nearby indoor activities
should rainy weather be predicted.
<ol>
<li>Improve upon the nature of the activities recommended to the user through
machine learning.
<ol>
<li>Features pertaining to itinerary collaboration can be enhanced, such as
tracking changes made to the itinerary and saving versions of it.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Additionally, <em>trippyy</em> has the potential to be <span
style="text-decoration:underline;">deeply connected with the travel and tourism
industry</span>. These future plans for integration and commercialisation are
illustrated below:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Add the option to allow users to purchase travel essentials, such as data
SIM cards, travel passes and attraction tickets through <em>trippyy</em> via a
package.
<ol>
<li>Add the option to allow users to book their flights and accommodation
through <em>trippyy</em> (e.g. pulling listings from Expedia, Trivago,
Booking.com, instead of referral links to these sites).
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
We also considered several future <span
style="text-decoration:underline;">marketing strategies</span> that could
propel<em> trippyy</em>’s service into the industry, these are illustrated as
such:
</p>
<ol>
<li>For Marketing and Scaling, one potential route we could take would be
Influencer Marketing. Our advertisers could be Youtubers who are travel
hobbyists/vloggers, or Popular Instagram micro-influencers in the niche of
travel/wanderlust/camping etc.
<ol>
<li>Instagram micro-influencers could solely market trippyy to their audiences
who could use our service that will be affiliated with other services such as
accommodation services.
<li>A more intricate model could involve the participation of tourist
attractions as well.  Proper reviews of attractions by these influencers could
be done as part of our marketing strategy for<em> trippyy</em>. Influencers that
agree to review certain attractions would publish their genuine reviews to their
YouTube channels, and leave a link in their description where viewers who are
interested in visiting the attraction can plan for their visit using
<em>trippyy</em>.  <strong>In essence, tourist attractions essentially pay
<em>trippyy</em> for increased publicity and reception, and <em>trippyy</em>
pays influencers for reviews of these attractions.</strong> In the long run, if
this marketing strategy is successful, greater collaborations involving more
tourist attractions themselves could sustain this marketing strategy
financially, and <em>trippyy</em> gains sustained usage from users.
<ol>
<li>Upon the launch of <em>trippyy</em>, one of our bottlenecks would be a lack
of awareness of<em> trippyy</em>’s services. Thus, as one of our target
audiences include young adults who spend a lot of time on Instagram, we also
plan to use Instagram filter games as a marketing strategy, since the usage of
Instagram filters tends to gain traction swiftly among Instagram users, and
increase the awareness of<em> trippyy</em>’s platform. Filters could include
unique games where the user with the highest score would win a prize, or simply
interactive filters that would warrant participation.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Timeline</span></strong>
</p>
<p>
For this project, we would have two main pillars to develop: the web interface
for the application, and the algorithm of the application.
</p>
<p>
We aim to come up with a functional web application by the end of Orbital, and
to launch the full application with extensions by the end of the year as we
expect there would be a significant spike in tourist activities when the
COVID-19 situation improves, and where travel restrictions are gradually
loosened.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Under the scope of Orbital, the following features are to be completed
by:</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">the end of May:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Week 1</span>
<p>
    <strong>General: </strong>Learn more about technologies required for the
project.
</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Week 2</span>
<p>
    <strong>General: </strong>Finalize ideas and technologies to use for the
project, come up with an updated proposal, poster and video.
</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Week 3</span>
<p>
    <strong>Web interface: </strong>Basic web interface of a layout page,
including a navigation bar and a simple design. Deploy via Heroku.
